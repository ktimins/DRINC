\chapter{Introduction}

    This design document provides documentation which will be used to 
    aid in software development by providing the details for how the 
    software should be constructed. This design document will also 
    provide some documentation about the hardware that will be used to 
    aid in the hardware development.

\section{Purpose}

    The purpose of this document is to describe the design of DRINC and 
    itâ€™s use cases. The purpose of the Design Document is to provide a 
    description of the design of a system fully enough to allow for 
    software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to 
    be built and how it is expected to be built. This document provides 
    information necessary to provide description of the details for the 
    software and system to be built.

\section{Scope}

    This software design document is for the base level system which 
    will work as a proof of concept for the use of building a system the 
    provides a base level of functionality to show feasibility for large 
    scale production use.
