\section{Broad Scale Description}

The \theTitle{} (\subTitle{}) is a machine that can create drinks from
multiple bottles or sources. Such a machine has the potential to produce
drinks with higher accuracy of mixture proportions.\footnote{Humans use
methods like seconds poured or pour equivalent heights in a glass, but 
none actually measure the volume that has flown through the spout.} Along
with this, humans tend to have differing tastes and likes. This means
that the recipe for a drink could vary between customer to customer.
To reach the desired potential for the \subTitle{} machine, it must be 
able to automate the creation of the drink and be able to accept any recipe
that uses the ingredients, and quantities, it contains. While there are
multiple drink pouring machines available on the internet ~\cite{BaR2D2}
~\cite{Inebriator}, the \subTitle{} will allow for easier automation and
use.
