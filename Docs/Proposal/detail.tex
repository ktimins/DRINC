\section{More Detail} %% Someone should change this section title

The \subTitle{} will have an array of multiple bottles. This allows for
a massive variety of mixed drinks. To be able to handle this, the machine
will handle this task by having a database containing a list of drinks. 
To be able to measure the amount of each liquid in the mixtures, the 
machine will measure the flow of the liquid. This will also allow the 
\subTitle{} to keep track of how much of each liquid is left, at any given
time.

The \subTitle{} will have two front ends: one via a web site and one via an
Android tablet. The web site will allow the owner to administer the machine.
The Android tablet will be attached to the machine. This will be the main
front-end used by the user to select a drink to pour.
